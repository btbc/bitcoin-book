<h2 id="segwit">Appendix A: Segregated Witness</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Segregated Witness (segwit) is an upgrade to the bitcoin consensus rules and network protocol, proposed and implemented as a BIP-9 soft-fork that is currently (mid-2017) pending activation.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In cryptography, the term "witness" is used to describe a solution to a cryptographic puzzle. In bitcoin terms, the witness satisfies a cryptographic condition placed on a unspent transaction output (UTXO).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In the context of bitcoin, a digital signature is <em>one type of witness</em>, but a witness is more broadly any solution that can satisfy the conditions imposed on an UTXO and unlock that UTXO for spending. The term “witness” is a more general term for an “unlocking script” or “scriptSig.”</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Before segwit’s introduction, every input in a transaction was followed by the witness data that unlocked it. The witness data was embedded in the transaction as part of each input. The term <em>segregated witness</em>, or <em>segwit</em> for short, simply means separating the signature or unlocking script of a specific output. Think "separate scriptSig," or “separate signature” in the simplest form.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Segregated Witness therefore is an architectural change to bitcoin that aims to move the witness data from the <code>scriptSig</code> (unlocking script) field of a transaction into a separate a <em>witness</em> data structure that accompanies a transaction. Clients may request transaction data with or without the accompanying witness data.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In this section we will look at some of the benefits of Segregated Witness, describe the mechanism used to deploy and implement this architecture change, and demonstrate the use of Segregated Witness in transactions and addresses.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph pagebreak-before"><p>Segregated Witness is defined by the following BIPs:</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Segregated Witness is an architectural change that has several effects on the scalability, security, economic incentives, and performance of bitcoin:</p></div>
<div class="dlist"><dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">
Transaction Malleability 
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
By moving the witness outside the transaction, the transaction hash used as an identifier no longer includes the witness data. Since the witness data is the only part of the transaction that can be modified by a third party (see <a href="#segwit_txid">[segwit_txid]</a>), removing it also removes the opportunity for transaction malleability attacks. With Segregated Witness, transaction hashes become immutable by anyone other than the creator of the transaction, which greatly improves the implementation of many other protocols that rely on advanced bitcoin transaction construction, such as payment channels, chained transactions, and lightning networks.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
Script Versioning 
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
With the introduction of Segregated Witness scripts, every locking script is preceded by a <em>script version</em> number, similar to how transactions and blocks have version numbers. The addition of a script version number allows the scripting language to be upgraded in a backward-compatible way (i.e., using soft fork upgrades) to introduce new script operands, syntax, or semantics. The ability to upgrade the scripting language in a nondisruptive way will greatly accelerate the rate of innovation in bitcoin.

Network and Storage Scaling 
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
The witness data is often a big contributor to the total size of a transaction. More complex scripts such as those used for multisig or payment channels are very large. In some cases these scripts account for the majority (more than 75%) of the data in a transaction. By moving the witness data outside the transaction, Segregated Witness improves bitcoin’s scalability. Nodes can prune the witness data after validating the signatures, or ignore it altogether when doing simplified payment verification. The witness data doesn’t need to be transmitted to all nodes and does not need to be stored on disk by all nodes.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
Signature Verification Optimization 
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Segregated Witness upgrades the signature functions (<code>CHECKSIG</code>, <code>CHECKMULTISIG</code>, etc.) to reduce the algorithm&#8217;s computational complexity. Before segwit, the algorithm used to produce a signature required a number of hash operations that was proportional to the size of the transaction. Data-hashing computations increased in O(n<sup>2</sup>) with respect to the number of signature operations, introducing a substantial computational burden on all nodes verifying the signature. With segwit, the algorithm is changed to reduce the complexity to O(n).
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
Offline Signing Improvement 
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Segregated Witness signatures incorporate the value (amount) referenced by each input in the hash that is signed. Previously, an offline signing device, such as a hardware wallet, would have to verify the amount of each input before signing a transaction. This was usually accomplished by streaming a large amount of data about the previous transactions referenced as inputs. Since the amount is now part of the commitment hash that is signed, an offline device does not need the previous transactions. If the amounts do not match (are misrepresented by a compromised online system), the signature will be invalid.

<h4 id="_how_segregated_witness_works">How Segregated Witness Works</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>At first glance, Segregated Witness appears to be a change to how transactions are constructed and therefore a transaction-level feature, but it is not. In fact, Segregated Witness is also a change to how individual UTXO are spent and therefore is a per-output feature.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A transaction can spend Segregated Witness outputs or traditional (inline-witness) outputs or both. Therefore, it does not make much sense to refer to a transaction as a “Segregated Witness transaction.” Rather we should refer to specific transaction inputs as “Segregated Witness inputs."</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When a transaction spends an UTXO, it must provide a witness. In a traditional UTXO, the locking script requires that witness data be provided <em>inline</em> in the input part of the transaction that spends the UTXO. A Segregated Witness UTXO, however, specifies a locking script that can be satisfied with witness data outside of the input (segregated).</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_soft_fork_backward_compatibility">Soft Fork (Backward Compatibility)</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Segregated Witness is a significant change to the way outputs and transactions are architected. Such a change would normally require a simultaneous change in every bitcoin node and wallet to change the consensus rules&#x2014;what is known as a hard fork. Instead, segregated witness is introduced with a much less disruptive change, which is backward compatible, known as a soft fork. This type of upgrade allows nonupgraded software to ignore the changes and continue to operate without any disruption.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Segregated Witness outputs are constructed so that older systems that are not segwit-aware can still validate them. To an old wallet or node, a Segregated Witness output looks like an output that <em>anyone can spend</em>. Such outputs can be spent with an empty signature, therefore the fact that there is no signature inside the transaction (it is segregated) does not invalidate the transaction. Newer wallets and mining nodes, however, see the Segregated Witness output and expect to find a valid witness for it in the transaction’s witness data.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_segregated_witness_output_and_transaction_examples">Segregated Witness Output and Transaction Examples</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Let’s look at some of our example transactions and see how they would change with Segregated Witness. We’ll first look at how a Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH) payment is transformed with the Segregated Witness program. Then, we’ll look at the Segregated Witness equivalent for Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH) scripts. Finally, we’ll look at how both of the preceding Segregated Witness programs can be embedded inside a P2SH script.</p></div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="p2wpkh">Pay-to-Witness-Public-Key-Hash (P2WPKH)</h5>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In <a href="#cup_of_coffee">[cup_of_coffee]</a>, Alice created a transaction to pay Bob for a cup of coffee. That transaction created a P2PKH output with a value of 0.015 BTC that was spendable by Bob. The output’s script looks like this:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">Example P2PKH output script</div>
<div class="content">
<pre><code>DUP HASH160 ab68025513c3dbd2f7b92a94e0581f5d50f654e7 EQUALVERIFY CHECKSIG</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>With Segregated Witness, Alice would create a Pay-to-Witness-Public-Key-Hash (P2WPKH) script, which looks like this:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">Example P2WPKH output script</div>
<div class="content">
<pre><code>0 ab68025513c3dbd2f7b92a94e0581f5d50f654e7</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>As you can see, a Segregated Witness output’s locking script is much simpler than a traditional output. It consists of two values that are pushed on to the script evaluation stack. To an old (nonsegwit-aware) bitcoin client, the two pushes would look like an output that anyone can spend and does not require a signature (or rather, can be spent with an empty signature). To a newer, segwit-aware client, the first number (0) is interpreted as a version number (the <em>witness version</em>) and the second part (20 bytes) is the equivalent of a locking script known as a <em>witness program</em>. The 20-byte witness program is simply the hash of the public key, as in a P2PKH script</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Now, let’s look at the corresponding transaction that Bob uses to spend this output. For the original script (nonsegwit), Bob’s transaction would have to include a signature within the transaction input:</p></div>

The sender has no way of knowing if the recipient&#8217;s wallet has the ability to construct segwit transactions and spend P2WPKH outputs.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Additionally, P2WPKH outputs must be constructed from the hash of a <em>compressed</em> public key.

<div class="paragraph"><p>The second type of witness program corresponds to a Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH) script. We saw this type of script in <a href="#p2sh">[p2sh]</a>. In that example, P2SH was used by Mohammed&#8217;s company to express a multisignature script. Payments to Mohammed&#8217;s company were encoded with a locking script like this:</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Now, let&#8217;s look at how this entire example would be upgraded to segwit. If Mohammed&#8217;s customers were using a segwit-compatible wallet, they would make a payment, creating a Pay-to-Witness-Script-Hash (P2WSH) output that would look like this:</p></div>

</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Again, as with the example of P2WPKH, you can see that the Segregated Witness equivalent script is a lot simpler and omits the various script operands that you see in P2SH scripts.

<div class="paragraph"><p>In the previous two sections, we demonstrated two types of witness programs: <a href="#p2wpkh">[p2wpkh]</a> and <a href="#p2wsh">[p2wsh]</a>. Both types of witness programs consist of a single byte version number followed by a longer hash. They look very similar, but are interpreted very differently: one is interpreted as a public key hash, which is satisfied by a signature and the other as a script hash, which is satisfied by a redeem script. The critical difference between them is the length of the hash:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
The public key hash in P2WPKH is 20 bytes

<h4 id="_upgrading_to_segregated_witness">Upgrading to Segregated Witness</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>As we can see from the previous examples, upgrading to Segregated Witness is a two-step process. First, wallets must create special segwit type outputs. Then, these outputs can be spent by wallets that know how to construct Segregated Witness transactions. In the examples, Alice&#8217;s wallet was segwit-aware and able to create special outputs with Segregated Witness scripts. Bob&#8217;s wallet is also segwit-aware and able to spend those outputs. What may not be obvious from the example is that in practice, Alice&#8217;s wallet needs to <em>know</em> that Bob uses a segwit-aware wallet and can spend these outputs. Otherwise, if Bob&#8217;s wallet is not upgraded and Alice tries to make segwit payments to Bob, Bob&#8217;s wallet will not be able to detect these payments.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In this case Bob&#8217;s wallet can construct a P2SH address that contains a segwit script inside it.

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="segwit_txid">Transaction identifiers</h5>
<div class="paragraph"><p>One of the greatest benefits of Segregated Witness is that it eliminates third-party transaction malleability.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Before segwit, transactions could have their signatures subtly modified by third parties, changing their transaction ID (hash) without changing any fundamental properties (inputs, outputs, amounts). This created opportunities for denial-of-service attacks as well as attacks against poorly written wallet software that assumed unconfirmed transaction hashes were immutable.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>With the introduction of Segregated Witness, transactions have two identifiers, <code>txid</code> and <code>wtxid</code>. The traditional transaction ID <code>txid</code> is the double-SHA256 hash of the serialized transaction, without the witness data. A transaction <code>wtxid</code> is the double-SHA256 hash of the new serialization format of the transaction with witness data.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The traditional <code>txid</code> is calculated in exactly the same way as with a nonsegwit transaction. However, since the segwit transaction has empty <code>scriptSig</code>s in every input, there is no part of the transaction that can be modified by a third party. Therefore, in a segwit transaction, the <code>txid</code> is immutable by a third party, even when the transaction is unconfirmed.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <code>wtxid</code> is like an "extended" ID, in that the hash also incorporates the witness data. If a transaction is transmitted without witness data, then the <code>wtxid</code> and <code>txid</code> are identical. Note than since the <code>wtxid</code> includes witness data (signatures) and since witness data may be malleable, the <code>wtxid</code> should be considered malleable until the transaction is confirmed. Only the <code>txid</code> of a segwit transaction can be considered immutable by third parties and only if <em>all</em> the inputs of the transaction are segwit inputs.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Unfortunately, the way the commitment hash was calculated introduced the possibility that a node verifying the signature can be forced to perform a significant number of hash computations. Specifically, the hash operations increase in O(n<sup>2</sup>) with respect to the number of signature operations in the transaction. An attacker could therefore create a transaction with a very large number of signature operations, causing the entire bitcoin network to have to perform hundreds or thousands of hash operations to verify the transaction.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Segwit represented an opportunity to address this problem by changing the way the commitment hash is calculated. For segwit version 0 witness programs, signature verification occurs using an improved commitment hash algorithm as specified in BIP-143.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The new algorithm achieves two important goals. Firstly, the number of hash operations increases by a much more gradual O(n) to the number of signature operations, reducing the opportunity to create denial-of-service attacks with overly complex transactions. Secondly, the commitment hash now also includes the value (amounts) of each input as part of the commitment. This means that a signer can commit to a specific input value without needing to "fetch" and check the previous transaction referenced by the input. In the case of offline devices, such as hardware wallets, this greatly simplifies the communication between the host and the hardware wallet, removing the need to stream previous transactions for validation. A hardware wallet can accept the input value "as stated" by an untrusted host. Since the signature is invalid if that input value is not correct, the hardware wallet doesn&#8217;t need to validate the value before signing the input.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Bitcoin mining nodes and full nodes incur costs for the resources used to support the bitcoin network and the blockchain. As the volume of bitcoin transactions increases, so does the cost of resources (CPU, network bandwidth, disk space, memory). Miners are compensated for these costs through fees that are proportional to the size (in bytes) of each transaction. Nonmining full nodes are not compensated, so they incur these costs because they have a need to run an authoritative fully validating full-index node, perhaps because they use the node to operate a bitcoin business.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Without transaction fees, the growth in bitcoin data would arguably increase dramatically. Fees are intended to align the needs of bitcoin users with the burden their transactions impose on the network, through a market-based price discovery mechanism.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The calculation of fees based on transaction size treats all the data in the transaction as equal in cost. But from the perspective of full nodes and miners, some parts of a transaction carry much higher costs. Every transaction added to the bitcoin network affects the consumption of four resources on nodes:</p></div>
<div class="dlist"><dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">
Disk Space 
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Every transaction is stored in the blockchain, adding to the total size of the blockchain. The blockchain is stored on disk, but the storage can be optimized by “pruning” older transactions.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
CPU 
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Every transaction must be validated, which requires CPU time.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
Bandwidth 
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Every transaction is transmitted (through flood propagation) across the network at least once. Without any optimization in the block propagation protocol, transactions are transmitted again as part of a block, doubling the impact on network capacity.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
Memory 
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Nodes that validate transactions keep the UTXO index or the entire UTXO set in memory to speed up validation. Because memory is at least one order of magnitude more expensive than disk, growth of the UTXO set contributes disproportionately to the cost of running a node.
</p>
</dd>
</dl></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>As you can see from the list, not every part of a transaction has an equal impact on the cost of running a node or on the ability of bitcoin to scale to support more transactions. The most expensive part of a transaction are the newly created outputs, as they are added to the in-memory UTXO set. By comparison, signatures (aka witness data) add the least burden to the network and the cost of running a node, because witness data are only validated once and then never used again. Furthermore, immediately after receiving a new transaction and validating witness data, nodes can discard that witness data. If fees are calculated on transaction size, without discriminating between these two types of data, then the market incentives of fees are not aligned with the actual costs imposed by a transaction. In fact, the current fee structure actually encourages the opposite behavior, because witness data is the largest part of a transaction.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The incentives created by fees matter because they affect the behavior of wallets. All wallets must implement some strategy for assembling transactions that takes into consideration a number of factors, such as privacy (reducing address reuse), fragmentation (making lots of loose change), and fees. If the fees are overwhelmingly motivating wallets to use as few inputs as possible in transactions, this can lead to UTXO picking and change address strategies that inadvertently bloat the UTXO set.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Transactions consume UTXO in their inputs and create new UTXO with their outputs. A transaction, therefore, that has more inputs than outputs will result in a decrease in the UTXO set, whereas a transaction that has more outputs than inputs will result in an increase in the UTXO set. Let’s consider the <em>difference</em> between inputs and outputs and call that the “Net-new-UTXO.” That’s an important metric, as it tells us what impact a transaction will have on the most expensive network-wide resource, the in-memory UTXO set. A transaction with positive Net-new-UTXO adds to that burden. A transaction with a negative Net-new-UTXO reduces the burden. We would therefore want to encourage transactions that are either negative Net-new-UTXO or neutral with zero Net-new-UTXO.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Let’s look at an example of what incentives are created by the transaction fee calculation, with and without Segregated Witness. We will look at two different transactions. Transaction A is a 3-input, 2-output transaction, which has a Net-new-UTXO metric of &#x2013;1, meaning it consumes one more UTXO than it creates, reducing the UTXO set by one. Transaction B is a 2-input, 3-output transaction, which has a Net-new-UTXO metric of 1, meaning it adds one UTXO to the UTXO set, imposing additional cost on the entire bitcoin network. Both transactions use multisignature (2-of-3) scripts to demonstrate how complex scripts increase the impact of segregated witness on fees. Let’s assume a transaction fee of 30 satoshi per byte and a 75% fee discount on witness data:</p></div>
<dl>
<dt>Without Segregated Witness</dt>
<dd>
<p>Transaction A fee: 25,710 satoshi</p>
<p>Transaction B fee: 18,990 satoshi</p>
</dd>

<dt>With Segregated Witness</dt>
<dd>
<p>Transaction A fee: 8,130 satoshi</p>
<p>Transaction B fee: 12,045 satoshi</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Both transactions are less expensive when segregated witness is implemented. But comparing the costs between the two transactions, we see that before Segregated Witness, the fee is higher for the transaction that has a negative Net-new-UTXO. After Segregated Witness, the transaction fees align with the incentive to minimize new UTXO creation by not inadvertently penalizing transactions with many inputs.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Segregated Witness therefore has two main effects on the fees paid by bitcoin users. Firstly, segwit reduces the overall cost of transactions by discounting witness data and increasing the capacity of the bitcoin blockchain. Secondly, segwit’s discount on witness data corrects a misalignment of incentives that may have inadvertently created more bloat in the UTXO set.</p></div>
